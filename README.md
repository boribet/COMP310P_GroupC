The system we are designing will serve as a simple,
easy to use tool for university students organising movie nights in a fixed number
of available locations. Our aims regarding functionality are:
A student will be able to register, sign up for or organise film nights.
Browse available events and reviews of past events.
Organisers will be able to see how their event is filling up,
as well as attendants can see all the events they have tickets for.
